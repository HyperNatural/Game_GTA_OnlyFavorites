## Overview

The **OnlyFavorites** mod enhances your Grand Theft Auto V experience by restricting the player to carry only one weapon per category.

2. From now on, you'll only pick up the registered weapons, while non-registered weapons will be dropped automatically.

   - **ScriptHookV**
   - **ScriptHookVDotNet3**
   - **LemonUI**
